Notes for upload 1:
I uploaded my code with 4 models: Linear, Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic
You will need Yellowbricks and Seaborn. Everything else shoud be packaged into Anacondas
The yellowbrick graphics throw an error, but it is safe to ignore. You will have to manually run these blocks though
If you want just the model performance, scroll to the end of the file
